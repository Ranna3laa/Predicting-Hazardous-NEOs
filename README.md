# 🚀 Predicting Hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) 🌍☄️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a **Near-Earth Object (NEO)** is hazardous using NASA’s real-world dataset. The dataset contains **338,199 records** of space objects observed from **1910 to 2024**, with some classified as "hazardous," meaning they pose a potential threat to Earth.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The objective is to develop a **Machine Learning model** that accurately predicts the hazard level of NEOs. **Early identification** of dangerous asteroids is crucial for **planetary defense** and space safety.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
- **Source**: NASA's NEO Observations
- **Timeframe**: 1910 - 2024
- **Total Records**: 338,199
- **Target Variable**: `is_hazardous` (1 = Hazardous, 0 = Non-Hazardous)

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools
The following tools and libraries will be used to process data and build the classification model:
- **Python** 🐍: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Machine Learning Models** 🤖: Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks
- **Data Visualization** 📊: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing** 🔄

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess NASA’s NEO dataset.
   - Handle missing values and perform feature selection.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize key trends in the dataset.
   - Identify patterns in hazardous vs. non-hazardous NEOs.
3. **Model Development**
   - Train and evaluate classification models.
   - Compare model performance using accuracy metrics.
4. **Optimization & Deployment**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for best accuracy.
   - Deploy the model for real-time hazard predictions.

## 🔥 Why This Matters?
An accurate **NEO prediction model** can contribute to planetary defense strategies by helping scientists and space agencies **assess potential threats** and take necessary preventive measures.
